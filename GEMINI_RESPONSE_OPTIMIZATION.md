# Optimizing Gemini API Responses for Source-Rich Answers

This guide explains the changes made to improve Gemini API responses to include more detailed information and better source citations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering

The prompts sent to Gemini have been completely redesigned to encourage:

- More comprehensive, in-depth responses
- Specific extraction of facts, figures, dates, and quotes from sources
- Citation of sources for each key point or claim
- Structured formatting with clear sections
- Comparative analysis across different sources
- Longer, more detailed responses (minimum 250-300 words)

### 2. Improved Source Formatting

Sources are now provided to Gemini with enhanced context:

- Domain information (extracted from URLs)
- Relevance scores
- Publication dates when available
- Clear separation between source metadata and content
- Numbered references for easier citation

### 3. Optimized Model Parameters

Model parameters have been tuned for more detailed, factual responses:

- Increased token limit (from 1000 to 2000)
- Lower temperature (0.2) for more factual, less creative responses
- Adjusted top_p (0.9) for more focused token selection

### 4. Response Post-Processing

AI responses are now checked and enhanced:

- Verification of citation count
- Addition of citation reminders if citations are missing
- Structural enhancement for poorly formatted responses
- Automatic source section addition when missing

### 5. Fallback Mechanisms

If the primary prompt fails, a simplified but still detailed fallback prompt is used that:

- Explicitly requests source citations
- Asks for specific information extraction
- Provides clear formatting instructions

## Environment Variables

New environment variables to control response quality:

- `ENABLE_DETAILED_RESPONSES`: Set to `true` by default, enables all enhancements
- `GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS`: Increased to 2000 for longer, more detailed responses

## Expected Output Format

The Gemini API now produces responses with:

1. A comprehensive analysis section with frequent source citations
2. Key findings or takeaways with citations
3. A sources referenced section with details on each source

## Comprehensive Analysis
Recent developments in quantum computing include significant breakthroughs in error correction and qubit stability. Researchers at IBM have achieved a 99.9% fidelity rate with their latest superconducting qubits [1], representing a major step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. In parallel, Google's quantum team demonstrated quantum supremacy with their 53-qubit Sycamore processor, completing calculations in 200 seconds that would take conventional supercomputers 10,000 years [2].

A particularly promising advance is the development of topological qubits, which are inherently more stable against environmental noise. Microsoft's Station Q has reported initial success with Majorana fermions as building blocks for these qubits [3].

## Key Findings
- Error correction techniques have improved fidelity rates to 99.9% [1]
- Quantum supremacy demonstrated for specific computational tasks [2]
- New qubit technologies like topological qubits show promise for stability [3]

## Deployment Instructions

These enhancements are enabled by default. If you want to disable them:

1. Set `ENABLE_DETAILED_RESPONSES=false` in your environment variables
2. Set `USE_SIMPLIFIED_PROMPT=true` for even more simplified prompts

For best results in Vercel deployment, make sure to set `GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS=2000` and ensure your Gemini API key has sufficient quota.
