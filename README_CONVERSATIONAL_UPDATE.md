# EvaSearchGPT - Conversational Response Update

## Overview

We've updated EvaSearchGPT to produce more human-like, conversational responses while maintaining the comprehensive, detailed nature of the search results. This update creates a better balance between thorough research and friendly, approachable communication.

## Key Changes

1. **Conversational Bookends**: Responses now begin and end with a friendly, conversational tone while maintaining detailed information in the middle sections.

2. **Natural Language**: We've updated the prompting system to use more natural language, personal pronouns, and engaging explanations.

3. **Balanced Structure**: Responses follow a new structure that balances comprehensive research with approachable communication:
   - Friendly, conversational summary at the beginning
   - Detailed, well-cited report in the middle
   - Human-like conclusion with actionable takeaways

4. **Citation Integration**: References are still rigorous but presented in a more integrated, natural way throughout the text.
