# Extended Optimization for Vercel Serverless Functions

This update extends the timeouts and optimizes the search API implementation for Vercel's serverless environment to resolve 504 Gateway Timeout errors.

## Core Changes

### Search API Route
- Added individual abort controllers for each API call
- Set 24-second timeout for external APIs (doubled from previous 12 seconds)
- Limited result count to 5 per source for faster processing
- Added failover mechanisms to continue even when one API fails
- Optimized Gemini AI parameters with 20-second timeout (doubled from previous 10 seconds)
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types

### UI Improvements
- Added advanced loading indicator with progress steps
- Better error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- Improved error handling for different status codes

### Configuration
- Updated vercel.json to use 120-second function timeout (doubled from 60 seconds)
- Optimized search timeout settings in environment variables (SEARCH_TIMEOUT=120000)

## How to Test
1. Deploy to Vercel with the updated configuration
2. Try complex search queries like "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
3. Observe the enhanced loading indicator and faster response times

## Why This Works
- The previous implementation was vulnerable to timeouts in Vercel's serverless environment
- This update is specifically designed for serverless constraints with:
  - More aggressive timeouts
  - Better failover logic
  - Limited result processing
  - Progress indicators for longer operations

This implementation prioritizes reliability and user experience over comprehensive results.
