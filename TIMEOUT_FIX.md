# Optimizing for Performance and Timeout Issues

This update addresses 504 Gateway Timeout errors during search requests by:

1. Implementing individual timeouts for each search API
2. Increasing the default timeout to 25 seconds (from 10 seconds)
3. Reducing the result count to 8 per source (from 10)
4. Adding specific error handling for timeout scenarios
5. Improving user-facing error messages

## Changes:

- Updated search-apis.ts with better timeout handling
- Enhanced error handling in route.ts
- Added detailed error messages in SearchInterface.tsx
- Updated environment configuration with optimized values

## How to Test:

1. Deploy to Vercel with the updated config
2. Test with complex queries like "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
3. Monitor response times and success rates

## Environment Updates Required:

```
SEARCH_TIMEOUT=60000
MAX_RESULTS_PER_SOURCE=8
```

These changes will help prevent timeouts while maintaining search quality.
